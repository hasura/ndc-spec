# Scalar Types

The schema should describe any irreducible _scalar types_. Scalar types can be used as the types of columns, or in general as the types of object fields.

Scalar types define several types of operations, which extend the capabilities of the query and mutation APIs: _comparison operators_ and _aggregation functions_.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators extend the query AST with the ability to express new binary comparison expressions in the predicate.

_Note_: data connectors are required to implement the _equality_ operator for all scalar types, and that operator is distinguished in the query AST. There is no need to define the equality operator as a comparison operator.

For example, a data connector might augment a `String` scalar type with a `LIKE` operator which tests for a fuzzy match based on a regular expression.

A comparison operator is defined by its _argument type_ - that is, the type of the right hand side of the binary operator it represents.

To define a comparison operator, add a [`ComparisonOperatorDefinition`](../../reference/types.md#comparisonoperatordefinition) to the `comparison_operators` field of the schema response.

For example:

```json
{
  "scalar_types": {
    "String": {
      "aggregate_functions": {},
      "comparison_operators": {
        "like": {
          "argument_type": {
            "type": "named",
            "name": "String"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## Aggregation Functions

Aggregation functions extend the query AST with the ability to express new aggregates within the `aggregates` portion of a query. They also allow sorting the query results via the `order_by` query field.

_Note_: data connectors are required to implement the _count_ and _count-distinct_ aggregations for columns of all scalar types, and those operator is distinguished in the query AST. There is no need to define these aggregates as aggregation functions.

For example, a data connector might augment a `Float` scalar type with a `SUM` function which aggregates a sum of a collection of floating-point numbers.

An aggregation function is defined by its _result type_ - that is, the type of the aggregated data.

To define an aggregation function, add a [`AggregateFunctionDefinition`](../../reference/types.md#aggregatefunctiondefinition) to the `aggregate_functions` field of the schema response.

For example:

```json
{
  "scalar_types": {
    "Float": {
      "aggregate_functions": {
        "sum": {
          "result_type": {
            "type": "named",
            "name": "Float"
          }
        }
      },
      "comparison_operators": {}
    }
  },
  ...
}
```
