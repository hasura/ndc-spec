# Field Selection

A [`Query`](../../reference/types.md#query) can specify which fields to fetch. The available fields are either

- the columns on the selected collection (i.e. those advertised in the corresponding [`CollectionInfo`](../../reference/types.md#collectioninfo) structure in the [schema response](../schema/collections.md)), or
- fields from [related collections](./relationships.md)

The requested fields are specified as a collection of [`Field`](../../reference/types.md#field) structures in the `field` property on the [`Query`](../../reference/types.md#query).

## Nested Fields

Queries can specify nested field selections for columns which have structured types (that is, not simply a scalar type or a nullable scalar type).

In order to specify nested field selections, the `fields` property of the `Field` structure, which is a [`NestedField`](../../reference/types.md#nestedfield) structure.

If `fields` is omitted, the entire structure of the column's data should be returned.  

If `fields` is provided, its value should be compatible with the type of the column:

- For an object-typed column (whether nullable or not), the `fields` property should contain a `NestedField` with type `object`. The `fields` property of the `NestedField` specifies a [`Field`](../../reference/types.md#field) structure for each requested nested field from the objects.
- For an array-typed column  (whether nullable or not), the `fields` property should contain a `NestedField` with type `array`. The `fields` property of the `NestedField` should contain _another_ `NestedField` structure, compatible with the type of the elements of the array. The selection function denoted by this nested `NestedField` structure should be applied to each element of each array.

## Examples

### Simple column selection

Here is an example of a query which selects some columns from the `articles` collection of the reference data connector:

```json
{{#include ../../../../ndc-reference/tests/query/get_all_articles/request.json}}
```

### Example with Nested Object Types

Here is an example of a query which selects some columns from a nested object inside the rows of the `institutions` collection of the reference data connector:

```json
{{#include ../../../../ndc-reference/tests/query/nested_object_select/request.json:1}}
{{#include ../../../../ndc-reference/tests/query/nested_object_select/request.json:3:}}
```

Notice that the `location` column is fetched twice: once to illustrate the use of the `fields` property, to fetch a subset of data, and again in the `location_all` field, which omits the `fields` property and fetches the entire structure.

### Example with Nested Array Types

Here is an example of a query which selects some columns from a nested array inside the rows of the `institutions` collection of the reference data connector:

```json
{{#include ../../../../ndc-reference/tests/query/nested_array_select/request.json:1}}
{{#include ../../../../ndc-reference/tests/query/nested_array_select/request.json:3:}}
```

Notice that the `staff` column is fetched using a `fields` property of type `array`. For each staff member in each institution row, we apply the selection function denoted by its `fields` property (of type `object`). Specifically, the `last_name` and `specialities` properties are selected for each staff member.


## Requirements

- If the [`QueryRequest`](../../reference/types.md#queryrequest) contains a [`Query`](../../reference/types.md#query) which specifies `fields`, then each [`RowSet`](../../reference/types.md#rowset) in the response should contain the `rows` property, and each row should contain all of the requested fields.
