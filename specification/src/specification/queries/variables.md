# Variables

A [`QueryRequest`](../../reference/types.md#queryrequest) can optionally specify one or more sets of variables which can be referenced throughout the [`Query`](../../reference/types.md#query) object. 

Query variables will only be provided if the `foreach` [capability](../capabilities.md) is advertised in the capabilities response.

The intent is that the data connector should attempt to perform multiple versions of the query in parallel - one instance of the query for each set of variables. For each set of variables, each variable value should be substituted wherever it is referenced in the query - for example in a [`ComparisonValue`](../../reference/types.md#comparisonvalue).

## Example

In the following query, we fetch two rowsets of article data. In each rowset, the rows are filtered based on the `author_id` column, and the prescribed `author_id` is determined by a variable. The choice of `author_id` varies between rowsets.

The result contains one rowset containing articles from the author with ID `1`, and a second for the author with ID `2`.

```json
{
  "collection": ["articles"],
  "collection_relationships": [],
  "query": {
    "fields": {
      "title": {
        "type": "column",
        "column": "title"
      }
    },
    "predicate": {
        "type": "binary_comparison_operator",
        "operator": {
            "type": "equal"
        },
        "column": {
            "name": "author_id"
        },
        "value": {
            "type": "variable",
            "name": "author_id"
        }
    }
  },
  "variables": [
    { "author_id": "1" },
    { "author_id": "2" }
  ]
}
```

## Requirements

- If `variables` are provided in the [`QueryRequest`](../../reference/types.md#queryrequest), then the [`QueryResponse`](../../reference/types.md#queryresponse) should contain one [`RowSet`](../../reference/types.md#rowset) for each set of variables.
- If `variables` are not provided, the data connector should return a single [`RowSet`](../../reference/types.md#rowset).
