# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the _reference implementation_ of the specification, which will illustrate how to implement data connectors from scratch.

The reference implementation is written in Rust, but it should be possible to follow along using any language of your choice, as long as you can implement a basic web server and implement serializers and deserializers for the data formats involved.

It is recommended that you follow along chapter-by-chapter, as each will build on the last.
