# NDC Specification

This directory contains source materials for the NDC specification. The specification can be built using `mdbook`, or [read online](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec). If building with `mdbook`, you will also need to install [`mdbook-pagetoc`](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook-pagetoc).
