# Relationships from Nested Fields

## Purpose

This is not like the other RFCs, in that it doesn't add a new feature, but clarifies an existing one. Namely, we have had the ability, since [adding nested fields](./0003-nested-field-selection.md), to query with relationships in a nested field context. This RFC clarifies the behavior of that feature.

In NDC, we can express relationships in the context of a nested object. A GraphQL query might look like this:

```graphql
query {
    artists {
        # Nested array field:
        albums {
            title
            publisher_id

            # Related collection:
            publisher {
                name
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And the corresponding NDC request might look like this:

```json
{
    "collection": "artists",
    "arguments": {},
    "query": {
        "fields": {
            "albums": {
                "type": "column",
                "column": "albums",
                "fields": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "fields": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "fields": {
                            "title": {
                                "type": "column",
                                "column": "title"
                            },
                            "publisher": {
                                "type": "relationship",
                                "arguments": {},
                                "query": {
                                    "aggregates": null,
                                    "fields": {
                                        "name": {
                                            "type": "column",
                                            "column": "name"
                                        }
                                    }
                                },
                                "relationship": "album_publisher"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "collection_relationships": {
        "album_publisher": {
            "arguments": {},
            "column_mapping": {
                "publisher_id": "id"
            },
            "relationship_type": "object",
            "target_collection": "publishers"
        }
    }
}
```

This sort of query is not documented, and needs some clarification.

Note in particular that the relationship column mapping is evaluated in the context of the nested object on the source side: we refer to `publisher_id`, which is a column on the nested `album` object, not on the "current row", which will be at the top of the scope stack. 

This feature therefore ties in with the work on named scopes: we might want to consider keeping the ancestor scopes around on the stack as we descend into nested objects.

## Proposal

The proposal is to document the following clearly in the specification: connectors should _replace the element at the top of the scope stack_ (that is, the "current row") with the current nested object under consideration, each time evaluation descends into a `NestedObject`.

Specifically, column mappings will be evaluated in the context of the nested object's fields, and any other behaviors which rely on the current row will change accordingly:

- `RelationshipArgument::Column` will resolve to a field of the current nested object.

A note needs to be added to the specification to clarify that relationship mappings and arguments should read off the top of the scope stack.

Advantages are:

- This is supported in NDC today.
- This design allows us to express relationships from objects inside (possibly deeply-nested) nested arrays and objects.
- The related object appears in the response in the correct place, next to the related source object.
 
The main disadvantage is that we can only express join conditions which make sense in the context of the nested object. Named scopes will go some way towards helping here, but we wonâ€™t be able to express join conditions which use column mappings unless the columns on the source side are nested under the current object.

## Alternative Designs

- Instead, we can move the related objects to the top of the query, and change the column mapping data structure to allow mappings between nested fields (using field paths like we have elsewhere).
  - We would be able to express more join conditions, but we would lose the ability to express relationships from data inside nested arrays. Related data would also not appear next to its counterpart on the source side.

## Future Work

1. Extend column mappings to allow references to nested object fields.
1. Extend column mappings to allow references to [named scopes](./0015-named-scopes.md).

## Notes

Everywhere this change is relevant, the scope stack should consist of a single entry, because the stack only grows inside an `Expression::Exists`, and we never specify field selections inside expressions. It's hard to imagine a future feature which would require this. 

Therefore, mentioning the scope stack at all is possibly confusing, and we could perhaps simplify this proposal by introducing a second notion of "current row", and talking in terms of fields on the current row in various places.

However, the current row is always the head of the scope stack (scope number zero is the current row), so the two are related. We would need a note to make sure the two are the same, which might be just as confusing.

Therefore, the proposal is to define the "current row" in terms of the more complicated stack concept, and to continue to allow indexing into the stack only when named scopes are enabled.

Also, nested fields may end up becoming more like relationships, with `Query` structures of their own, so the idea that the scope stack ends at the nearest enclosing `Query` would translate over to nested fields. At that point, each nested field would begin its own scope stack, and it would make sense then to have framed things in terms of stacks.
