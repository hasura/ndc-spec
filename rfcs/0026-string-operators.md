# New String Comparison Operators

## Problem

We want to standardize the `starts_with`, `ends_with` and `contains` operators, and their case-insensitive counterparts.

## Solution

- Add new comparison operator meanings for each of these operator types.
- Specify their semantics in the documentation
- Add operators and tests to the reference implementation
